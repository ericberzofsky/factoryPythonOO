# factoryPythonOO
A quick dabble into the use of Python Objects. Python doesn't enforce object oriented classes like other languages. In this quick example, I use a Python class to simulate the smallest warehouse in the world, capable of handling just three (configurable) products. When this limit is reached, an exception, for which a class of its own was created, is thrown.
